Siadat Software Backend Engineer Interview Project

## Develop a RESTful API using .NET Core that serves as the backend for the 2-player memory game.
The API will handle game initialization, player turns, card matching logic, score tracking, and resetting the game.

Requirements:

1. Game Initialization:

Create an endpoint to start a new game. This should shuffle the cards and prepare the game board with 20 cards (10 pairs) placed randomly.
Initialize player scores to 0 and randomly decide which player starts the game.

2. Player Turns:

Develop an endpoint to handle a player's turn where they flip two cards. The request should specify the positions of the cards being flipped.
Implement the game logic:
If the cards match, remove the cards from the board, award a point to the current player, and allow them to take another turn.
If the cards do not match, flip the cards back over and switch turns to the other player.
Ensure the state of the game is correctly maintained after each turn.

3. Tracking Score and Game State:

Provide an endpoint to retrieve the current state of the game, including which cards are still in play, the scores of both players, and whose turn it is.

4. End Game and Reset:

Implement logic to determine when the game has ended (all pairs have been matched).
Create an endpoint to reset the game, allowing players to start a new game without restarting the server.

5. Error Handling and Validation:

Add appropriate error handling for invalid requests (e.g., flipping a card that doesn't exist, flipping more than two cards in a turn, taking a turn out of sequence).
Validate requests to ensure they meet the game rules.
